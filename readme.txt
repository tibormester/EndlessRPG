This project is primarily to create a video game that appeals to myself. 

The genres I hope to touch on and their inspirations are as follows:
	Rouge Like: Ability/Build modification and Loot RNG dependent, Minecraft Psi mod 'spell modification depth' but with Noita alchemy like complexity
	FPS: Fast and Smooth Movement, Sliding, Mantling, Wall running, Grappling hooks, etc... Warframe is a good example
	Souls-Like: Skill based combat, telegraphed heavy attacks requiring dodge/parries, directional swings and spacing
	Open World: Infinite terrain generation with dungeones, biomes (resources, wildlife, enemies), simulated economy, even politics eventually? More importanly a diverse array of elemental and mundane interactionss: Fire, Liquids, Gasses, Gravity, Force(Wind), Time Dilations etc... Biomes will be themed around these and flora and fauna will have abilities with these modifications
	Sandbox: Persistent progression, player will have a mobile base (air ship, normal ship, pocket dimension etc...), can build a place to live and store momentos from adventures, but also crafting progression where engaging with increased complexity yields increased efficiency and benefits, using factorio like assembly lines and automations to create gear and equipment. But also the player character themselves are a canvas to be edited. Rimworld like body modifications to affect stats and to provide different alchemical substances to be utilized in the modular abilities
